# My CTF Learning Journey  

I am passionate about exploring the world of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges as a way to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity. I regularly participate in CTF events hosted on platforms such as [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/) and [DreamHack](https://dreamhack.io/). These challenges provide an incredible opportunity to learn and apply practical techniques across various categories, such as pwnable, web exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, and more.  

## My Approach to CTFs  

When tackling challenges, I aim to focus on understanding the underlying concepts and methodologies rather than just solving the tasks. My process generally includes:  

1. **Analyzing the Challenge**: Carefully reading the problem statement to identify hints or key components.  
2. **Creating Payloads and Scripts**: Writing custom payloads and scripts to exploit vulnerabilities or analyze data efficiently.  
3. **Documenting Progress**: Saving the payloads and scripts as a record of my solution.  

Although I strive to document my work in detailed write-ups, I occasionally find myself prioritizing efficiency over documentation. At times, I save just the payloads and scripts without writing comprehensive explanations.  

## Why Write-ups Matter  

I recognize that writing detailed write-ups is a valuable part of the learning process. It allows me to reflect on the challenges, consolidate my understanding, and share insights with the community. Moving forward, I aim to improve this aspect by dedicating more time to documenting my journey, even when I feel lazy.  

## Goals  

- Continue participating in CTF challenges on popular platforms.  
- Improve my problem-solving speed and efficiency.  
- Develop better documentation habits by posting detailed write-ups.  
- Share my work with others to contribute to the cybersecurity community.  

## Platforms I Use  

- [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/) 
- [DreamHack](https://dreamhack.io/)  

## Conclusion  

CTFs have been a critical part of my growth in the cybersecurity field. They allow me to gain hands-on experience and continually challenge myself to learn new techniques. As I progress, I aim to balance both solving challenges and sharing knowledge through more structured write-ups.
